# World Bank API Data Dashboard using Flask

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the world bank API. 
Data is pulled directly from the API and then visualized using Plotly.

## Getting Started 

This flask app can be run from the terminal and viewed in the browser, at the 3000 port by default.
See the details below.

## Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:
- python3
- python packages in the requirements.txt file

 Install the packages with
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Branches

The `master` branch contains code that can be run in a local environment. 
The `heroku` branch contains code that can be deployed over to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Installing

On a MacOS/linux system, installation is easy. Open a terminal, and 
go into the directory with the flask app files. Run `python worldbank.py` in the terminal.
